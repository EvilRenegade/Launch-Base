Future Launch Base development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. integrate dcoder's dll.
2. extract ra2md.csf and ra2.csf to Resources on first load, rather than every mod launch. note in help that these can be removed to force a refresh
3. language check for RA2/YR to get correct OptRA2Lang and OptYRLang

4. include VC++ files (possibly make optional download - detect when trying to use syringe and dlls not present in windows!)
5. LBP loader
6. bag/idx/csf sizes for korea/china
7. add new skins to setup.nsi? WEBSITE
8. are there any other places that need a space check? new save games, new map snapshots, scripted video, log files, user config
9. come up with own routine for generating unique machine id using CPU and MAC and optional HD volume
10. use md5deep instead of vb code? - author=Jesse Kornblum
11. new option - import XCC mod launcher
12. Test that LB handles safe files properly.
13. Ability to add links to programs?
14. Residual file manager is unsetting all safe files when 1 is removed. This should be changed to just lose the missing file.
15. sidec03.mix in side3 rejected for copying because cannot access sidec02md.mix. Is this correct?
