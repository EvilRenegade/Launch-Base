Command Line Arguments
Launch Base provides some command line arguments that you can use in shortcuts to the program.
These arguments can automatically launch specific mods, or can be used to temporarily enable or disable certain options.
The available arguments are listed below.

[file.ipb]
If file.ipb exists and is located within a valid mod's folder, then Launch Base will automatically launch that mod and play the specified IPB video.
If file.ipb includes any spaces in the filename then it should be enclosed in quotes.
Remember that Launch Base automatically adds a date/time stamp and version information to new IPB filenames so make sure you type the full filename correctly.
You can associate IPB files with Launch Base - double clicking them will run Launch Base with the chosen file as the only argument.
This argument must be the very first argument otherwise it will be ignored. This argument will also be ignored if the -game switch has been used and the folder doesn't match. However, if you do use the -game switch, then file.ipb can be a relative path. For example:
    LaunchBase.exe "C:\LaunchBase\Mods\my mod\my video file.ipb"
    LaunchBase.exe "my video file.ipb" -game "my mod"
...will both have the same effect.

-game subfolder
Subfolder should be a folder within your Launch Base 'Mods' directory that contains a Launch Base mod.
Do *not* specify a mod's actual name - only the folder name.
This mod will be automatically launched once Launch Base has loaded. Launch Base will close automatically once Red Alert 2/Yuri's Revenge closes.
Use        LaunchBase.exe -game ORIGINALYR        for unmodded Yuri's Revenge.
Use        LanuchBase.exe -game ORIGINALRA2        for unmodded Red Alert 2
Use        LaunchBase.exe -game ORIGINALFA2        for unmodded FinalAlert 2 YR.
If subfolder has any spaces in the name then it should be enclosed in quotes like so:
    LaunchBase.exe -game "Just another YR mod"

-tx
If this switch is used then the Terrain Expansion FinalAlert 2 mod will be launched automatically in conjunction with whatever other FinalAlert 2 mod you choose to launch, regardless of whether or not the 'Integrate Terrain Expansion' checkbox is ticked. You must actually have the Terrain Expansion FinalAlert 2 mod otherwise an error will occur.

-nosplash
This will disable the splash screen that appears while Launch Base is loading.
Disabling the splash screen may cause Launch Base to load a few seconds more quickly on some systems.

-dev
This option is for authors only. If this switch is used then 'Developer Mode' will be enabled.
Developer Mode has the following properties:
'Persistent Mods' will be disabled, regardless of what the option is normally set to.
'Recompile Mods' will be enabled, regardless of what the option is normally set to.
'Verify Plugin Security Keys' will be disabled, regardless of what the option is normally set to.
The right-click menus for plugins and FinalAlert 2 mods will include the 'Open Containing Folder' option. This option normally isn't included for plugins or FinalAlert 2 mods because they do not contain any user-generated content.
