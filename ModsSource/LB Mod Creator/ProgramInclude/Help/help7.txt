This help page is for the authors of the Terrain Expansion plugin. If you are not a member of the Terrain Expansion team then you needn't read this page.

The Terrain Expansion will be installed to a single subfolder within the Launch Base 'Mods' directory, even though it is including the Terrain Expansion FinalAlert 2 mod (the TX FA2 Mod is an "overlay" that is applied to normal FA2 Mods).
Launch Base Mod Creator will generate a single installer for this.

Note that the installer will not work if the user does not have Launch Base - the installer is for Launch Base users only (as with all installers created by this program).

Below is a step-by-step guide to setting up Launch Base Mod Creator for the Terrain Expansion installer.

1. Input the settings as for a normal plugin. The Mod Type should be set to 'plugin'.

2. Select 'Plugin *is* TX' from the Terrain Expansion frame on the Options tab.

3. On the Files tab, place the FinalAlert 2 files in the fa2files category as with a normal FinalAlert 2 mod.
In addition, place any non-fa2files that are part of the Terrain Expansion FinalAlert 2 mod in the fa2files category (for example, <snowmd.ini>).
This is the only case where non-FA2 files in the fa2files category will be permitted - no other FinalAlert 2 mod can do this.

4. Files placed in any other category will all be inserted into expandmd06.mix (or expand06.mix for the Terrain Expansion FinalAlert 2 mod).
You can place <expandmd06.mix> in the video category if you prefer to pre-compile it yourself.

The rest of the steps are the same as for a normal plugin.

Note that the <marble.mix> patching facility was written with the Terrain Expansion specifically in mind so please make use of this if you are able.
